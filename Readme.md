# kotlin-multiplatform-template

Ready to use - execute `gradle build` to create packages and run tests

## Deployment

For JVM, use the artifact containing "jvm" in build/libs/

For JS, the two needed JS files are packaged into a jar containing "js".
Alternatively, the `package.json` and `kotlin` folder in build/js/packages/[project]/ can together be used/published as a node module.
